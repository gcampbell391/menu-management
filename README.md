# Menu Management
A front end application built to manage menus for restuarants. 

A user can:
- View exisiting menu items
- Create a new menu item
- Edit an existing menu item
- Delete an exisiting menu item
- Navigate between different menus

There is no backend, API, or database involved. All of the data manipulation is controlled through state management using React Hooks and a static data file.
